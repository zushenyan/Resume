About Me
---

Started programming since I was 14. The reason is much the same as other programmers starting programming at young age - want to build games, yeah!

First programming language is C, and had played around with languages like Java, C++, Python and blah after then.

I am currently excited about how great the potential Web application has in near future, and decided to get involved in Web development field.

Sometimes I read these websites to help me to catch up the trend:
